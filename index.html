                        Pay attention to word patterns - sometimes words might be related by their structure or usage rather than their meaning.

                      <li>
                        Consider multiple meanings of words - a single word might have different interpretations that could lead to the correct
                        grouping.
                      </li>
                      <li>Look for theme-based connections - words might be related to sports, food, or entertainment.</li>
                      <li>Don't rush - take time to analyze all possibilities before making your selection.</li>
                      <li>Use process of elimination - as you find correct groups, the remaining words become easier to categorize.</li>
